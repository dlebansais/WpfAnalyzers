# MCA1003 Verified method is missing suffix.

If a method has any of the contract attributes (`Access`, `RequireNotNull`, `Require` or `Ensure`) then it should end with the `Verified` suffix (or the suffix defined in the project settings).

## Sample code

```cs
[Access(""public"", ""static"")] // MCA1003: Verified method is missing suffix.
private static void Foo()
{
}
```

Conformant code:

```cs
[Access(""public"", ""static"")]
private static void FooVerified()
{
}
```
