# MCA2001 Object must be initialized.

If a constructor is tagged with the `InitializeWith` attribute, any time a new instance of the corresponding class is created but not immediately followed by a call to the initializer, this warning is issued.

## Sample code

````csharp
using System;
using System.Net;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Contracts;

public class Foo
{
    private readonly Uri uri;

    [InitializeWith(nameof(InitializeContentAsync))]
    public Foo(Uri uri) => this.uri = uri;

    public string Content { get; private set; } = null!;

    public async Task InitializeContentAsync()
    {
        using WebClient webClient = CreateClient();
        Content = await webClient.DownloadStringTaskAsync(uri);
    }

    protected virtual WebClient CreateClient() => new();
}
````

````csharp
Foo foo = new(new Uri("http://whatever")); // MCA2001: Object must be initialized
````

````csharp
Foo foo = new(new Uri("http://whatever")); // Compliant
await foo.InitializeContentAsync();
````
