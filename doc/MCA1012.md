# MCA1012 Require attribute has too many arguments.

The `Require` attribute only accepts one expression as argument when `DebugOnly` is specified.

## Sample code

```cs
[Require("text1.Length > 0", "text2.Length > 0", DebugOnly = true)] // MCA1012: Require attribute has too many arguments.
private void FooVerified(string text1, string text2)
{
}
```
