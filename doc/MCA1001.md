# MCA1001 Verified method must be private.

If a method has any of the contract attributes (`Access`, `RequireNotNull`, `Require` or `Ensure`) then it should be private.

## Sample code

```cs
[Access(""public"", ""static"")] // MCA1001: Verified method must be private.
protected static void FooVerified()
{
}
```
