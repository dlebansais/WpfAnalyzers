# MCA2003 InitializeWith attribute not allowed in class with explicit constructors.

The `InitializeWith` attribute is used by constructors. It can also be used by a class, but only if the class has no explicit constructors. In this case, the attribute applies to the implicit constructor generated by the compiler.

## Sample code

````csharp
using Contracts;

[InitializeWith(nameof(Initialize))] // MCA2003: InitializeWith attribute not allowed in class with explicit constructors
public class Foo
{
    public Foo()
    {
    }

    public void Initialize()
    {
    }
}
````

````csharp
using Contracts;

[InitializeWith(nameof(Initialize))] // Compliant
public class Foo
{
    public void Initialize()
    {
    }
}
````
