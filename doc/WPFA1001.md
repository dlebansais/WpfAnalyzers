# WPFA1001 Missing InitializeComponent.

In a constructor for a class that has code-behind and Xaml files, it is almost always an error to not call `InitializeComponent`, a method generated by the Xaml compiler.

This warning is emitted when `InitializeComponent` is not called directly. Calls embedded in a `if` conditional or made in different methods are not detected and will generate the warning.

## Sample code

```cs
public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
    public MainWindow() // WPFA1001: Call to InitializeComponent missing in 'MainWindow'
    {
        DataContext = this;
    }
}
```

```cs
public partial class MainWindow : Window
{
    public MainWindow()
    {
        InitializeComponent(); // Compliant
        DataContext = this;
    }
}
```
