# MCA1002 Verified method must be within type.

If a method has any of the contract attributes (`Access`, `RequireNotNull`, `Require` or `Ensure`) then it should be within a `class`, `struct` or `record`, itself within a `namespace`.

## Sample code

```cs
[Access(""public"", ""static"")] // MCA1002: Verified method must be within type.
private static void FooVerified()
{
}
```

Conformant code:

```cs
namespace Test;

internal class Program
{
    [Access(""public"", ""static"")]
    private static void FooVerified()
    {
    }
}
```
